# Meta Capstone Project: Little Lemon Restaurant Database Schema and Entity Relationship Modeling

Welcome to the readme file for the Meta Capstone Project, focused on building the Little Lemon restaurant database schema and entity relationship modeling. This document provides an overview of the project and the systems used, as well as the steps to complete the project.

## Systems Used

The following systems are utilized in the project:

1. **Git**: Version control system for tracking changes and enabling collaboration.
   - Download Git from: [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
   - Refer to subsequent readings for installation and usage instructions.

2. **MySQL**: Database management system for storing and accessing information.
   - MySQL Workbench, command-line interface, or application clients can be used.
   - Download MySQL from: [https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/)

3. **Python**: Programming language used for communicating with the database.
   - Python is the preferred method for interacting with the MySQL database.
   - Download Python from: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

4. **Tableau**: Business intelligence tool for analyzing and visualizing data.
   - Tableau is used for extracting and displaying meaningful information.
   - Visit [https://www.tableau.com/](https://www.tableau.com/) for more information.

## Scenario

Little Lemon requires a booking system to track guest visits. In this first stage of the project, you will complete the following steps:

1. **Repository Setup**:
   - Set up a repository or local directory to house your code.
   - Initialize Git in the project directory using the `git init` command.

2. **Record Changes**:
   - Use Git to track and record all modifications made to the project.
   - Add changes to the staging area using `git add <file>` or `git add .` (for all files).
   - Commit changes with a descriptive message using `git commit -m "Commit message"`.

3. **Collaboration**:
   - Share the Git repository with others involved in the project.
   - Allow others to view, review, and contribute to the code by providing appropriate access permissions.

Please refer to the subsequent lectures and readings for detailed instructions on using Git, MySQL, Python, and Tableau for the project.

## Project Steps

Follow these steps to complete the Little Lemon Restaurant Database Schema and Entity Relationship Modeling project:

1. Set up a Git repository to manage the project code and track changes.
2. Design the database schema for the Little Lemon restaurant, considering tables, relationships, and attributes.
3. Create the necessary SQL statements to create the database and tables in MySQL.
4. Implement the database schema by executing the SQL statements in MySQL.
5. Develop a Python application to communicate with the MySQL database.
6. Write code to handle user input and update the database based on bookings and guest visits.
7. Test the Python application to ensure it correctly interacts with the database.
8. Explore the data using Tableau to extract meaningful information and generate visualizations.
9. Analyze the data in Tableau and identify patterns or trends relevant to the restaurant's operations.
10. Document the project, including the schema, SQL statements, Python code, and Tableau visualizations.
11. Update the Git repository with all project files and changes made during the development process.
12. Collaborate with others by sharing the Git repository and allowing them to review and contribute to the code.

Follow these steps in a sequential manner, documenting your progress and updating the Git repository as you complete each task.

Happy coding and collaboration!
